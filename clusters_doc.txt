Creating clusters document
==========================

The script to create clusters using popularity-contest submissions is the
one named create_popcon_clusters.py. This script groups similar submissions into
clusters, by analising popularity-contest submission's packages.

The first step of this script is to get all Debian packages in Packages.gz
on /srv/mirrors/debian/dists/stable/*/binary-i386/Packages.gz and
/srv/mirrors/debian/dists/unstable/*/binary-i386/Packages.gz, those Packages.gz
can be founded on ftp://ftp.br.debian.org. After collect all packages names
then those are ordered and are removed libraries and documents
with the regex '^lib.*' and '.*doc$'.

The second step is to create a submissions matrix, where each line is a
popularity-contest submission in binary format, and each column represents
a Debian package. This can be seen on the example bellow:

  - debian packages:            git, gedit, vagrant, vim,
  - submission matrix:           1     0       1      0
                                 0     0       1      1

Analising the examples, the first popularity-contest submission have the
packages 'git' and 'vagrant', the second submission have the packages
'vagrant', and 'vim'.

The third step is to remove the unused packages from matrix. In the given
example, the column represeting the package 'gedit' will be removed. After that,
the matrix will be in the following format:

  - debian packages:            git, vagrant, vim,
  - submission matrix:           1      1      0
                                 0      1      1

The fourth step is to remove packages that are not used by many user. To do
that, it is removed packages that used by less then 5% of users. This step is
used to remove packages that can identify an user.

Once that is done, the submission matrix is used to calculate the clusters with
class KMeans of python-sklearn. This clusters are saved on clusters.txt.

  - clusters.txt explanation:
    - This file contains the clusters positions in a cartesian plane, where
    each line represents a cluster. Each line of this file contains the
    cluster position into cartesian plane, example:

      - 0.1;0.5;0.7
      - 0.3;0.4;0.9

    - The cluster 0 is on the position [0.1, 0.5, 0.7] on cartesian plane, and
    the cluster 1 is on the position [0.3, 0.4, 0.9].

    - The dimensions of this cartesian plan is the total number of packages
      after removing the ones that are not used by any user and the ones that
      used by few userd.

    - The clusters values are necessary in order to calculate the distance
    between the clusters and a new point into cartesian plan, in this case the
    new point is a new popularity-contest submission. With this distances it is
    possible to know what the best cluster for this point will be, of course,
    the best cluster is the one what is closer to the point.

Another output of create_popcon_clusters script is a relation between
packages and the clusters that packages are included, whereas the submission
zero, that contains 'git' and 'vagrant', is on the cluster zero, and the
submission one, that contains 'vagrant' and 'vim', is on the cluster one, the
relation between packages and clusters follows the following example:

  - pkgs_clusters: git-0:1
                   vagrant-0:1;1:1
                   vim-1:1

This exemple shows that the package 'git' appears on cluster zero, one time,
and the package 'vagrant' appears on cluster zero, one time, and on cluster
one, one time, and the package vim appears on cluster one, one time.

The relation between packages and clusters are saved on pkgs_clusters.txt, this
file and the cluster.txt are saved on the popcon_clusters folder
